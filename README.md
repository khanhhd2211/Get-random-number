# Get-random-number
Take random numbers so that the sum equals a fixed number

Use `getNum(fixedNum, n)` in random.R file
- fixedNum: fixed number which is the sum of random numbers
- n: ratio to generate numbers
  - Example (n = 5): Increase by 0.2 (0, 0.2, 0.6, ... 4)
  - Example (n = 10): Increase by 0.1 (0, 0.2, 0.6, ... 4)
  
By default there are 4 numbers generated in it, you can modify it by edit the .R file:
- First number: range from 0 - 4
- Second number: range from 0 - 1
- 3rd number: range from 0 - 1
- 4th number: range from 0 - 4

Example in this file: generate 4 random child points so that the sum equals a total point
